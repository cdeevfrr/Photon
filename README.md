# Spawn
A video game.

# Name is actually TBD, spawn is reserved for somethign else.
### Description
The interesting point of this game is that it _looks_ like a 3D world, but it's not actually 3D. Instead, there's a grid/matrix/graph of nodes and edges, but they just start out as a 3D matrix of adjacencies. The point of the game is to modify which nodes are adjacent to which other nodes to create new things.

Items, particles, movement, and vision all travel along these adjacencies.

Things the players construct exist on/in nodes, and may be able to affect other nodes LOCALLY ONLY.

Each node may have any number of out-edges in a particular direction. Ex you may have 5 out edges in the Z direction (the global 'backwards' or 'forwards' direction - note that the player's backwards may not be Z) If something tries to move in the Z direction, depending on what it is it might:
- duplicate and one duplicate travels along each adjacency
- pick an adjacency to travel along at random
- some other behavior

Vision is a really tricky question in this game. For now I'm using ray tracing - make a vector from player-eye pointing outward for each pixel, convert that vector to a list of directions like [up, up, left, forward], and then trace that line to see what it hits. 


## Developing
This repo is ABSOLUTELY in its infancy. There's a ton to develop & it's not setup for onboarding new people yet - please email or message me (cdeevfrr) directly if you want to contribute!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
